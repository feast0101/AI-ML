AI/ML FIRST LAB
Please read this section. This is valuable to get you prepared, even if it's a long read -- it's important stuff.
Your first Frontier LLM Project
Let's build a useful LLM solution - in a matter of minutes.

By the end of this course, you will have built an autonomous Agentic AI solution with 7 agents that collaborate to solve a business problem. All in good time! We will start with something smaller...

Our goal is to code a new kind of Web Browser. Give it a URL, and it will respond with a summary. The Reader's Digest of the internet!!

Before starting, you should have completed the setup for PC or Mac and you hopefully launched this jupyter lab from within the project root directory, with your environment activated.

If you're new to Jupyter Lab
Welcome to the wonderful world of Data Science experimentation! Once you've used Jupyter Lab, you'll wonder how you ever lived without it. Simply click in each "cell" with code in it, such as the cell immediately below this text, and hit Shift+Return to execute that cell. As you wish, you can add a cell with the + button in the toolbar, and print values of variables, or try out variations.

I've written a notebook called Guide to Jupyter to help you get more familiar with Jupyter Labs, including adding Markdown comments, using ! to run shell commands, and tqdm to show progress.
